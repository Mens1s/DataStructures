<h1>What is a MidTermWorks.Union Find?</h1>
<p>
MidTermWorks.Union Find is a data structure that keeps track fo elements which are split into one or more disjoint sets.
Its has two primary operations: find and union
</p>

<h2>When and where is a MidTermWorks.Union Find used?</h2>

<li>Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm.</li>
<li>Grid percolation.</li>
<li>Network connectivity.</li>
<li>Least common ancestor in trees.</li>
<li>Image processing.</li>

<h2>Complexity</h2>

<li>Construction  =>   O(N)</li>
<li>MidTermWorks.Union  =>   a(N)</li>
<li>Find  =>   a(N)</li>
<li>Get component size  =>   a(N)</li>
<li>Check if connected  =>   a(N)</li>
<li>Count components  =>   O(N)</li>
a(N) => amortized constant time
