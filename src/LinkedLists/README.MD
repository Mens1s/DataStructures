<h2>Where are linked lists used?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Used in many list, queue & stack implementations.</li>
<li>Great for creating circular lists.</li>
<li>Can easily model real world objects such as trains.</li>
<li>Used in separate chaining, which is present certain Hashtable implementatiions to
deal with hashing collisions</li>
<li>Often used in the implementation of adjacency lists for graphs.</li>
</ul>
